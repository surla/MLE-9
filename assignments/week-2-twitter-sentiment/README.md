### Creating a Week 2 Repository
Let's get started by creating a Week 2 Repository!

<details>
  <summary>Creating your Week 2 Repository</summary>
  <br>

1. The first thing to do is create a new empty public repository!

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19699016/176268864-0893db99-f496-4e0f-8860-fc635ec76106.png)

2. Be sure to fill out your repository name, description, and ensure it's public! NOTE: DO NOT ADD A README OR LICENSE

3. Now that you've done the required set-up on GitHub.com, let's move to our terminal and clone the MLE-9 repository!
     
     ```console
     git clone git@github.com:FourthBrain/MLE-9.git
     ```
     
4. OPTIONAL: If you've already cloned the MLE-9 repository - feel free to pull the recent changes by `cd`ing into the directory that contains the MLE-9 repo, and running this command. Be sure to return to the parent directory before moving on! (`cd ..`)
     
     ```console
      git pull origin main
     ```

5. Now, we're going to copy the contents of the assignment to a new folder using the following command
     
     ```console
     cp -r MLE-9/assignments/week-2-twitter-sentiment .
     ```
     
6. Once that is complete, we'll `cd` into the newly created folder with
     
     ```console
     cd week-2-twitter-sentiment
     ```
     
7. Now, let's init our repository in this folder using
     
     ```console
     git init
     ```
     
8. We'll add the contents of the folder using
     
     ```console
     git add .
     ```
     
9. Let's create an initial commit!
     
     ```console
     git commit -m "Initial Commit"
     ```
     
10. Now we can add our created repository as a remote using the following command. Don't forget, you can get the SSH address from your repository by clicking the green `Code` button on GitHub.com!
     
     ```console
     git remote add main git@github.com:<YOUR GITHUB USERNAME>/<YOUR REPOSITORY NAME>
     ```
     
11. Now we'll set our branch to `main`
     
     ```console
     git branch -M main
     ```
     
12. Last, but not least, let's push the contents of our commit to our repo!
     
     ```console
     git push -u main main
     ```
 
13. That's it, that's all!

### Setting up your environment üêçüñ•Ô∏è

Create a new Conda environment for sentiment anaylsis (sa)
```console
  conda create -n sa python=3.8 jupyter -y
```
Activate your new environment
```console
  conda activate sa
```

Open the jupyter-notebook
```console
  jupyter-notebook
